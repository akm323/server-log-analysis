# server-log-analysis
The purpose of analyzing server log files is to extract useful information for system management, security reports, and maintenance from a server's log files. Though it appears simple and straightforward at a glance, it is tightly connected with essential issues in many research fields such as information retrieval, data mining, and hypertext analysis.
A text line displaying the log file often constitutes basic information on the visitation including a sequence number, visiting time, user's IP address, the URL requested, status code of the visitation, length of data sent, and other fields related to user agent, host, and page, etc. Each line of a server's log file may be viewed as a document containing a sequence of fields. Each field of the documents parsed from the log files can be viewed from a channel perspective. All these perspectives are the basis for discovering topics and visualizing the server log file in the proposed approach.
Events found in the sea of log messages are important in an overall analysis of the state of the network and its services. All of them contain informative text messages conveying the actions taken by network applications. In general, the log records produced by different applications may differ dramatically in both format and the kinds of events they convey. Hence, the discovery of useful patterns in these text-based records is a theme that brings about both opportunities and challenges.
