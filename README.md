# server-log-analysis
Server log management is a critical task for organizations relying on web services, but it often presents challenges such as processing large volumes of data, identifying performance bottlenecks, and detecting security threats. Traditional approaches may be inefficient, lacking real-time updates or actionable insights. The proposed system addresses these issues by providing a real-time, web based solution for analyzing and visualizing server log data. Built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, 
Pandas, and Plotly, the system streamlines log analysis through intuitive dashboards and advanced visualizations. It identifies key metrics such as frequent IPs, request patterns, status code distributions, and device, allowing administrators to monitor server activity effectively. This system empowers users to quickly detect anomalies, optimize server performance, and enhance security by uncovering patterns and irregularities in the data. With user-friendly interfaces, it ensures that administrators have immediate access to critical insights, facilitating prompt and informed decision-making. By resolving the inefficiencies of traditional log 
management, the system is an essential tool for improving server reliability and operational efficiency. The system employs quantitative methodologies to derive insights from numeric and structured log data, presenting the results through intuitive visualizations and summary metrics. By combining robust data processing capabilities with interactive dashboards, this system is a comprehensive tool for server management and performance analysis, streamlining troubleshooting and decision-making processes.
# How to run the system
Make sure to create the .env file and give a value to the SECRET_KEY in it. Then run the main.py and go to website link, now you have the system running.
